# ✅ Netlify Forms — Quick Deploy Checklist

**Migration**: Formspree → Netlify Forms  
**Status**: Ready to deploy  
**Time**: 10 minutes  

---

## 🚀 Pre-Deploy Verification

### 1. Files Created ✅

- [x] `public/_redirects` — SPA routing
- [x] Hidden form template in `index.html`

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify files exist
ls -la public/_redirects
grep "velora-contact" index.html
```

**Expected**:
- `_redirects` contains: `/*    /index.html   200`
- `index.html` has hidden form before `</body>`

---

### 2. App.tsx Updated ✅

**Manually edited** (verify these changes exist):

- [ ] Form has `name="velora-contact"`
- [ ] Form has `data-netlify="true"`
- [ ] Form has `netlify-honeypot="website"`
- [ ] Hidden input: `<input name="form-name" value="velora-contact" />`
- [ ] Honeypot field: `<input name="website" style={{ display: 'none' }} />`
- [ ] `encode()` function added
- [ ] `handleSubmitNetlify()` function added
- [ ] Formspree code removed

**Quick grep check**:
```bash
grep "data-netlify" App.tsx
grep "handleSubmitNetlify" App.tsx
grep "encode(" App.tsx
```

---

### 3. Build Test

**Run**:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

**Verify build output**:
```bash
# Check hidden form in build
grep "velora-contact" dist/index.html

# Check _redirects in build
cat dist/_redirects

# Should see: /*    /index.html   200
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ `dist/index.html` contains hidden form
- ✅ `dist/_redirects` exists with correct content

---

### 4. Local Preview Test

**Run**:
```bash
npm run preview
```

**Test** (http://localhost:4173):
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Scroll to "Get in Touch" form
- [ ] Form fields visible
- [ ] Privacy notice visible
- [ ] Navigate to `/pilot` — loads correctly
